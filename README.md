# GhostDetectRedesign

This page is a redesign proposal for a recently acquired tool by AcademicInfluence.com.


If features total responsiveness down to a screen size of 320px, the smallest device screen size. Margins, paddings, font-size, width, etc. are responsive, giving the page more space on bigger screen size and less empty space on smaller screens. The advertisement and related articles have also been recreated. The graph svgs, which were not very mobile-friendly, are now more compatible on smaller screens. The sections are more detailed, giving it a structured look. The Faces output used on this page also has the smile/frown feature, using images since this page does not have access to the actual algorithm. 

This page (except the header/footer which were made 3-4 weeks before) uses no media queries. It is pure css/html that makes it responsive.

This page (again except the header/footer and 'render data' button for the client) uses no javascript.
